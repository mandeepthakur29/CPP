Some Important Terms:

1.) Node: A node is a basic unit of a tree data structure. Each node contains data and may have links to other 
        nodes. Nodes represent elements in the tree.

2.) Root:The root is the topmost node of a tree. It is the only node in the tree that has no parent. All other 
        nodes in the tree are descendants of the root.

3.) Children: Children are nodes that are directly connected to another node when moving away from the root. A 
            node can have zero or more children. In a binary tree, each node can have at most two children.

4.) Parent: A parent is a node that has one or more children. The parent node is directly connected to its children 
            nodes. In other words, if node A has a direct link to node B, then A is the parent of B.

5.) Sibling: Siblings are nodes that share the same parent. For example, if node A is the parent of both node B and 
            node C, then node B and node C are siblings.

6.) Ancestor: An ancestor of a node is any node that is on the path from the root to that node. This includes the 
            node itself, its parent, its parent's parent, and so on up to the root.

7.) Descendant: A descendant of a node is any node that is on the path from that node to the leaf nodes. This 
                includes the node itself, its children, its children's children, and so on down to the leaf nodes.

8.) Leaf: A leaf is a node that has no children. In other words, it is a node at the bottom of the tree, with no 
        further nodes connected below it.
