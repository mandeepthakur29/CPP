=> Graph theory is a field of mathematics and computer science that studies structures made 
of nodes (or vertices) and edges (connections between nodes). Graphs can represent many 
real-world problems, such as networks, social media connections, and routes.

Graph (G): A graph 𝐺=(𝑉,𝐸) is defined by a set of vertices V (also called nodes) and a 
set of edges 𝐸 that connect pairs of vertices.

A.))) Types of Graphs:
    a.) Undirected Graph:

An undirected graph is one where the edges do not have any direction. In other words, 
an edge between vertex u and vertex v means you can move from u to v and from v to u.
Example: A social network connection, where friendship is mutual.

=> Example:
    A -- B -- C
    |         |
    D ------- E

    b.) Directed Graph (Digraph):

In a directed graph, the edges have a direction. An edge from vertex u to vertex v 
(denoted u→v) means you can move from u to v, but not necessarily from v to u.
Example: A Twitter network where one person follows another, but the following isn't 
necessarily mutual.

=> Example:
    A → B →  C
    ↑        ↓
    D ←----- E

    c.) Weighted Graph:

A weighted graph is one where each edge has an associated weight (or cost). The weight 
could represent distances, costs, or time between vertices.
Example: A road map where each road between cities has a distance or cost associated 
with it.

=> Example (Weighted):
    A --10--- B
    |         |
    5         9
    |         |
    C ---7--- D

    d.) Unweighted Graph:

In an unweighted graph, all edges have the same weight, typically considered as 1. 
This means that any connection is treated equally.

B.))) Graph Terminology:

1.)Degree of a Vertex: The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it.
    a.) In-degree (directed graph): The number of edges coming into a vertex.
    b.) Out-degree (directed graph): The number of edges going out from a vertex.

    => Example (In-degree and Out-degree):
        A → B → C
        ↑       ↓
        D ←-----E

        In-degree of B = 1, Out-degree of B = 1
        In-degree of C = 1, Out-degree of C = 1

2.) Path: A path is a sequence of edges that connect a sequence of vertices. A simple 
    path does not repeat any vertices.

=> Example: In an undirected graph, a path from A to D might look like 𝐴→𝐵→𝐷.

3.) Connected Graph: A graph is said to be connected if there is a path between every 
    pair of vertices. In a disconnected graph, some vertices are not connected.

=> Example (Disconnected Graph):
    A -- B     C -- D
    In this graph, there is no path between A and C, so it's disconnected.

4.) Complete Graph: A complete graph is one where there is an edge between every pair 
    of vertices.

=> Example (Complete Graph):
    A -- B -- C
    | \  |  / |
    D -- E -- F

C.))) Special Graphs:
    1.) Tree: A tree is a connected, acyclic graph. It has 𝑛 vertices and 𝑛−1 edges, 
        and it has no cycles.
