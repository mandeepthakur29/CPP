In C++, the virtual keyword is primarily used in two contexts: for virtual functions and for virtual inheritance. Lets discuss each:

Virtual Functions:

Virtual functions allow a class to provide a specific implementation of a function that can be overridden by derived classes.
They enable runtime polymorphism, where the function to be called is determined at runtime based on the actual type of the object.
Virtual functions are used in scenarios where you want different behavior for the same function based on the type of the object.
Without virtual functions, if you call a function through a base class pointer or reference that points to a derived class object, 
the base class version of the function is called.
By declaring a member function as virtual in a base class, you ensure that derived classes can provide their own implementations of that 
function.
The override specifier is used in derived classes to explicitly mark that a virtual function overrides a virtual function in the base 
class, improving code readability and preventing errors.


Virtual Inheritance:

Virtual inheritance is used to resolve issues related to multiple inheritance, particularly the "diamond problem."
The diamond problem occurs when a class inherits from two classes that have a common base class. This leads to ambiguity in the derived 
class regarding which base class member to use.
When a class is virtually inherited, only one instance of the common base class is shared among the derived class and its ancestors, 
ensuring that there are no duplicate base class subobjects.
Virtual inheritance is used to avoid issues such as redundant member data and ambiguity in function calls due to multiple inheritance.
It's typically used in complex inheritance hierarchies where multiple inheritance is necessary, but careful management of shared base class subobjects is required.
